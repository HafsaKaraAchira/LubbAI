# LubbAI ‚Äî PDF Semantic Search & Summarization App

**LubbAI** is a semantic search and summarization tool for PDF documents. It extracts the core meaning (*lubb*) of your content using advanced AI models (OpenAI/Gemini).

---

A modern three-tier web application that lets users upload a PDF, search its contents semantically, and get concise summaries using OpenAI or Google Gemini (current version).

### Folder Breakdown
- **core/**: Python code for extracting, chunking, embedding, searching, and summarizing PDF content using AI.
- **server/**: Node.js backend providing REST API endpoints for file upload, search, and summary. Bridges frontend and AI core.
- **client/**: React app for uploading PDFs, searching, and displaying semantic results and summaries in a clean UI.
- **_data/**: Stores intermediate data, output files, or artifacts generated during processing.
- **_samples/**: Contains example PDFs or sample data for demos and testing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- **Client** (`client/`): React frontend
- **Server** (`server/`): Node.js REST API
- **Core** (`core/`): Python AI logic

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Node.js ‚â• 16
- Python ‚â• 3.8
- `pip` and `virtualenv`

## ‚ö° Setup

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HafsaKaraAchira/LubbAI.git
   cd LubbAI
   ```

2. **Install dependencies for each tier**
   - **Client:**
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     # or
     yarn install
     ```
   - **Server:**
     ```bash
     cd ../server
     npm install
     ```
   - **Core:**
     ```bash
     cd ../core
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage: Run the App

You can automate starting the server and client using the provided scripts:

1. **Start the server (must be started first):**
   ```bash
   ./run_server.sh
   ```
   This script will launch the Node.js backend server.

2. **Start the client (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   ./run_client.sh
   ```
   This script will launch the React frontend.

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

   cd LubbAI

### Core (Python)
cd core
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Server (Node)
cd ../server
npm install

### Client (React)
cd ../client
npm install


## Configure environment variables
Create a .env in each tier as needed‚Äîsee tier README files.

## Running the App

From project root, open three terminals:

### Core

cd core
source venv/bin/activate
python main.py  # Optional: run tests or demo script

### Server

cd server
npm start

### Client

cd client
npm start

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
